(PÃ¸z) Lightweight Discord theme meant to not look dogshit like all other themes currently.

I feel like most of the other themes either go mental and mess with stuff which shouldn't be changed; for example servers layout or window buttons. 
but with this theme all i want to do is make the colouring better & give it a bit more spice to look more modern in specific areas.

I will also remove stuff which i find stupid; for example stickers. I cannot think of anything more imaginably more annoying so that is why they are just blocked in this theme.
This theme will also aim to provide better security, for example in Subscriptions setting page your email will be willingly shown, but with this theme it is not (unless YOU hover over it).

## Installation
### Powercord

### Better Discord
download poz.theme.css and put it into your themes folder. (if it doesn't work remove the first line because im too lazy 2 make the compiler not add it)

### Anything else
idk try to git clone it.

### What is the spotify playing thing at the bottom left?

### Useful javascript for collecting selectors
When an element is only styled when hovered or smth else, you can use this javascript to pause after 3 seconds to make it so you can grab out the element picker and look at it's styling
```js
td = (t=3e3) => {setTimeout(()=>{debugger},t)}
```
to use just do td() or if you want a longer delay put in the milliseconds as the first parameter
